## I'm Baptiste Guilcher
I'm a **Game Programmer**. i'm currently at the last years of my studiest at [ESMA](https://www.esma-artistique.com/?utm_term=esma%20jeu%20video&utm_campaign=ASUC%20-%20Search%20-%20ESMA%20Artistique&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=1749986737&hsa_cam=843358225&hsa_grp=50859734838&hsa_ad=705541968169&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-892398793866&hsa_kw=esma%20jeu%20video&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiArKW-BhAzEiwAZhWsIAkW0M4rpcnAs70Dyp9p_5Mbfb32gxIsOsPbIY9NBRdg8z4K8QgQrhoCgPYQAvD_BwE) and have been learning the craft of game dev since **2021**


I started programing when i was 13 (on python and with scratch) and i continued to learn and progress since then with software like **Unity, Phaser, Scratch, Unreal Engine, MCreator ...**
\i really enjoy learning about programming in general and framework. over the years i've learned multiple programming language such as :
  
  
  • **c#**
  • **C++**
  • **Python**
  • **Java**
  • **HTML**


Today i'm still eager to learn and keep at trying new stuff and working with new code architecture, however i am more used to **C# in unity**
