I started programing when i was 13 (on python and with scratch) and i continued to learn and progress since then with software like **Unity, Phaser, Scratch, Unreal Engine, MCreator ...**
\i really enjoy learning about programming in general and framework. over the years i've learned multiple programming language such as :
- **C#**
- **C++**
- **Python**
- **Java**
- **HTML**


Today i'm still eager to learn and keep at trying new stuff and working with new code architecture, however i am more used to **C# in unity**


I Have skill in **UI/UX Programming,gameplay, Character Control** and currently experiment a lot on **procedural generation**

I am a **creative programmer :**  i have a real interest about programming and enjoy experimenting a lot with my current knowledge and expand on it to get to be more and more performant as a programmer.

I Enjoy Learning and progressing a lot. not just as a programmer but as a person in general and as such i study various field such as cooking , astronomy, biology and a bit of music as well
