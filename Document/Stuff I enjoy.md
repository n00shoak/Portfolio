# Stuff i enjoy ! 
Here is a list of activities and passions I really enjoy. Of course, I can't fit my entire life into one document, so if you'd like to get to know me better, feel free to offer me a coffee! (Cookies work well too üòã)

## üïπÔ∏è Video Games üïπÔ∏è   
### ü¶é Monster hunter

*I could go on for many lines about why I enjoy this game so much, but to keep the document clear, I‚Äôll stick to the main points. I enjoy Monster Hunter games because they are an intellectual challenge without being a ‚Äúhill‚Äù in difficulty: you're presented with a series of situations (the monster's attacks), and the goal is to react with the correct moves based on your avatar‚Äôs current state (from attack A, I can dodge, perform a counter, or use a shield‚Ä¶). Having clear knowledge of both the task and how to confront it feels really rewarding when you finally vanquish the monster and claim victory!  
Also, the Palicoes (the cats) are one of the big reasons I enjoy the game, they‚Äôre just so cute!*  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Factorio

*The game presents you with a variety of devices, and with it you get to produce resources that allow you to make better stuff that allows you to produce even more. For me, the joy in this game comes from getting to produce something, sometimes spending hours on math and design, and the second I'm done I already have a new way to improve on the system. Also, I got to experience the game completely differently recently: instead of establishing my own workflow within the game, I was brought into a friend's game who needed help and had to help him fix it and improve. Putting myself in a messy situation and getting to find out the problems and the required logic to fix it and share the produced reward with a friend is a really satisfying process I enjoy in this game.* 

### ‚öîÔ∏è Elden Ring

*That game taught me a lot, it's a hard game and you have to face many enemies, and you're meant to fail, you're meant to die and realise the strength of your opponents and learn from it, and only when I realised it is when I truly enjoyed the game because you don't fail by not achieving a task, you lose the game when you stop trying to fight. And I started to apply this logic to my work, to not get frustrated on small failure or mistakes, I can learn from them, get to prevent and prepare for potential errors and get to enhance my work as I go on and on!*

## üç¥ cooking üç¥  
i've been cooking since i was 3, learning various recipies in my familly but also enjoying learning and exploring new things by myself ! Here are a few desert i've learned to perfectione over the years :  
### ‚òÅÔ∏è meringues

*The recipe is simple: you mix egg whites until they form a fluffy and thick foam, add sugar, cook it for 5‚Äì8 hours (depending on the eggs), and you‚Äôre done. Yet the slightest change in any step gives you a very different result. Making sure each and every step is properly done, while trying to find new ways to improve the recipe, is a process I enjoy a lot. Also, it‚Äôs really high in sugar, so it‚Äôs always a nice snack.* 

### ü™µ Yule log

*My grandmother used to make lots and lots of Yule logs for the neighborhood. She shared the recipe with my mother, who then passed it on to me. The difficulty lies in guessing how to adjust the quantities depending on the eggs‚Äîif they're smaller, larger, denser, or more watery, you get a very different result. And if you're not careful enough, you can end up with a cake that's too thick to be rolled, or so thin it cracks at the slightest move. But the true joy of baking a Yule log comes from sharing it with family. It's usually made for special occasions and often means enjoying a good dessert with relatives I haven‚Äôt seen in a while.*
