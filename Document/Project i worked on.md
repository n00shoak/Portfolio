# ⚙️ __Project i worked on :__ 
here is a list off the realeased project i worked on
they are in chronological order from oldest to newest.
so if you see that the way i coded is really different, its because i learned and progressed between and within each project !

some of the project were made on phaser 3
here is a video of how you can launch them [aparently i need to do it my self]


### ⚔️ __Ominous Gaze__ (2022)
**my role :** *alone on the project*  
**pitch :** *your trying to escape a space ship you were emprisoned in but weird creature will hunt you on your way out*  
[you van get the files here](https://github.com/n00shoak/ominous_gaze)  
#### cool coding stuff done :  
> **AI : it was my first time dealing with ai and trying to give it fun behavior i had to keep it simple to fit in the dead line but i made it change its behavior depending on its health and proximity to the player to make it flee or fight. It isnt much but its the first of many and today i still enjoy developing ennemies with various behavior and paterns to challenge the player**
#### things i want to add / change : 
> the game currently lack of an end game but apart from redoing the project on an other engine it was pretty fun already
> maybe more fx to really enhance the omnius and grim ambiance i wanted for this project

### 👊 __DEL * . *__ (2022)
Game from the **2022 ETPA GameJam**  
**my role :** *animator*  
**pitch :** *you play various character inspired from computer brand and your goal is to dodge attacks to get to the end of the level*

### ⛏️ __Deep Down Below__ (2022)
**my role :** *alone on the project*  
**pitch :** *you play one of the miner in a mining team and your goal is to gather ressources to progress in increasingly hard caves and upgrade your gear*   

[you van get the files here](https://github.com/n00shoak/DeepDownBelow)  

#### cool coding stuff i did :  
> **Procedural generation :**   
(that was one of my first game it was really badly coded)  
the goal was to have a tunel shaped caves that wasnt just a straight line  
to reach that goal i first did the floor by creating an array of number, and then use each numbers to generate tile to that numbers height  
but it created some really hard to navigate maps so i changed it so that each number was averaged with its "neighbours" in the array   
then i set the ammount of neighbours and the strenght of the averaging to create various shape (and later used to have multiple biomes)  
and once the code for the ground was doe i copyed it and fliped the generation to have a roof  

#### things i want to add / change : 
> i want to redo it all with my current knowledge and use class / struct and loops instead of massive amount of line that just spawn stuff for procedural generation
and maybe some remote multiplayer instead of having everyone on the same keyboard.

### 🏐 __Space Pong__ (2023)
**my role :** *programmer*  
**pitch :** *its the game pong but you can play it up to four player*  
[you can try it out here](https://n00shoak.itch.io/space-pong)  
  
![a](https://github.com/n00shoak/Portfolio/blob/main/Document/Pictures/SpacePong.png)  
#### cool coding stuff done :  
> physics : most of the time i enjoy coding component and object behavior my self, but on that project i tryed to get out of my confort zone and try to work around collider effect. Doing so was a lot of fun and i could experiment a lot on the rigidbody's feature by changing how bouncy does the bars can be or adding a balck hole that pull the ball inside. Despite being a small project i really enjoyed playing this game and having four person on the same keyboard make it even funnier !

#### things i want to add / change : 
> being abble to select how many player are playing would be nice since the game isnt really made for less than four player. Also i think making the "arena" a circle would be interesting

### 🔒 __escape game__ (2023)
**my role :** *programmer*  
**pitch :** *stuck on a sunking military ship you try to find your way out through various puzzle*  
[you can try it out here]  
#### cool coding stuff i did :  
> **the water management puzzle :** its not only and indicator of how much time the player has left but having it interactable and making the player decide if its worht it to spend extra time on it to gain time was really intresting ! The puzzle itself is a series of room that can get filled of whater and comunicate their fill amount to the next room, it was a bit tidyous and i think i could make it simpler using a few videoclips and the Timeline tool to have something that look better

### ✈️ __Neon Shooter__ (2023)
**my role :** *alone on the project*  
**pitch :** *you play as a little spache ship and try to defend yourself from relentless ennemies* 
[you can try it out here](https://n00shoak.itch.io/neon-shooter)  
  
![a](https://github.com/n00shoak/Portfolio/blob/main/Document/Pictures/Neon%20Shooter.png)  
#### cool coding stuff i did :  
> *AI : i tryed to make some ennemies that were interesting to fight, thats why i implemented two key features for theyr behavior :*  
> - Player Distance based behavior : i used it so that the ennemis can rush the player if to faraway and start theyr attack patern when nearby  
> - Randomized statistic : on my first test the eneemies where stacked ont one another and where all doing the same thing at the same time, to prevent that , each ai start with few tweaks in theyr stats wich make them a little slower or faster and result in variation in theyr behavior**  
#### things i want to add / change : 
> i first planned to make it a rogue like and it would be nice to have upgrade as you progress through the game, and more ennemis that would be harder and harder to fight as the player get stronger to keep some challenge and fun !

### ⌨️ __Type it__ (2024)
its a little project i worked on, the goal was to make something fun that could help my little brother learn how to use a key board (goal achieved)
**my role :** *alone on the project*  
**pitch :** *a little typing game were you have to write words that apear in a short ammount of time to try and get the highest score*  
[you can try it out here](https://n00shoak.itch.io/type-it)   
  
![a](https://github.com/n00shoak/Portfolio/blob/main/Document/Pictures/TypeIt.png)  
#### things i want to add / change : 
> more difficulty tweaks and a way to add custom word so it works with multiple language or can use more complex words or sentence / maybe some slurs too
___


### 🏏 __Maxi PinBall__ (2024)
**my role :** *alone on the project*  
**pitch :** *it is a virtual pinball game*  
[you can try it out here](https://n00shoak.itch.io/maxi-pinball)  
#### cool coding stuff i did :  
> **FX : in that project i learned how to make interesting sound and visual effect to make the gameplay dynamic and keep the player focus on the action, its also in this project that i learned how to use proprely the animation tool in unity**
#### things i want to add / change :
> **make it codeless :**  
>  with my current knowledge of unity i belive that by simply using a mix of physical object / animations and event call i can drasticly reduce the ammount of custom script needed and despite not being the most optimise way to do a game it just seem like something fun to try.

### Unclock (2025)
**WIP**
