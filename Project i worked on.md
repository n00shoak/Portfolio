# ⚙️ __Project i worked on :__ 
here is a list off the realeased project i worked on
they are in chronological order from oldest to newest.
so if you see that the way i coded is really different, its because i learned and progressed between and within each project !

some of the project were made on phaser 3
here is a video of how you can launch them [aparently i need to do it my self]

#### cool coding stuff done :  
> **AI : it was my first time dealing with ai and trying to give it fun behavior i had to keep it simple to fit in the dead line but i made it change its behavior depending on its health and proximity to the player to make it flee or fight. It isnt much but its the first of many and today i still enjoy developing ennemies with various behavior and paterns to challenge the player**
#### things i want to add / change : 
> the game currently lack of an end game but apart from redoing the project on an other engine it was pretty fun already
> maybe more fx to really enhance the omnius and grim ambiance i wanted for this project

#### cool coding stuff done :  
> **Procedural generation :**   
(that was one of my first game it was really badly coded)  
the goal was to have a tunel shaped caves that wasnt just a straight line  
to reach that goal i first did the floor by creating an array of number, and then use each numbers to generate tile to that numbers height  
but it created some really hard to navigate maps so i changed it so that each number was averaged with its "neighbours" in the array   
then i set the ammount of neighbours and the strenght of the averaging to create various shape (and later used to have multiple biomes)  
and once the code for the ground was doe i copyed it and fliped the generation to have a roof  

#### things i want to add / change : 
> i want to redo it all with my current knowledge and use class / struct and loops instead of massive amount of line that just spawn stuff for procedural generation
and maybe some remote multiplayer instead of having everyone on the same keyboard.
