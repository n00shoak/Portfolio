# ⚙️ __Project i worked on :__ 
here is a list off the realeased project i worked on
they are in chronological order from oldest to newest.
so if you see that the way i coded is really different, its because i learned and progressed between and within each project !

some of the project were made on phaser 3
here is a video of how you can launch them [aparently i need to do it my self]

#### cool coding stuff done :  
> **Procedural generation :**   
(that was one of my first game it was really badly coded)  
the goal was to have a tunel shaped caves that wasnt just a straight line  
to reach that goal i first did the floor by creating an array of number, and then use each numbers to generate tile to that numbers height  
but it created some really hard to navigate maps so i changed it so that each number was averaged with its "neighbours" in the array   
then i set the ammount of neighbours and the strenght of the averaging to create various shape (and later used to have multiple biomes)  
and once the code for the ground was doe i copyed it and fliped the generation to have a roof  

#### things i want to add / change : 
> i want to redo it all with my current knowledge and use class / struct and loops instead of massive amount of line that just spawn stuff for procedural generation
and maybe some remote multiplayer instead of having everyone on the same keyboard.
